# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project aims to implement a Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in two-player games to make optimal decisions. The game will be developed using a programming language and will be designed to be played against the computer. The user will be able to choose the level of difficulty, and the game will have an AI opponent that will use the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. The project will involve implementing the game's logic and interface, as well as testing and debugging to ensure its functionality. The game will be implemented using the Model-View-Controller architecture and a graphical user interface. The Minimax algorithm will be used to determine the computer's moves, providing a competitive and intelligent opponent for players. The resulting game will be modular and extensible, allowing for future improvements and customization options. This project demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in game development and highlights the importance of careful design and implementation.
